# Installation

### Installing via NPM

The library is available [in NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dataclass) and can be
installed via NPM or similar package manager:

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install dataclass
```

### Installing via CDNs

The library can be imported via [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/). It is recommended to use `?module`
parameter to import ES Module version of the code:

```js:no-line-numbers
import { Data } from "https://unpkg.com/dataclass@2?module";
```

_Note: the library does not support [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format._

In similar way, the library can be imported via [esm.sh](http://esm.sh/). This can be useful for
[Deno](https://deno.land/) since this CDN also serves `.d.ts` files.

```ts:no-line-numbers
import { Data } from "https://esm.sh/dataclass@2";
```

_Note: it is preferable to put explicit version range in the URL._

## Troubleshooting

The library is shipped with CommonJS and ES Module support. The source code is written using ES2015
features. Given [the global reach](https://caniuse.com/es6-class) of ES2015 Classes it is very
likely you won't need to compile this type of things. If the environments you are targetting support
these features or you know for sure that a node module will be properly pre-compiled if necessary,
you can skip the rest of this guide.

If older standards support required, the bundler of choice needs to be configured to transpile
`dataclass` dependency as well. Assuming you would like to use `dataclass` for its typings benefits,
you already have the build step in your environment.

### Using with Parcel or Vite

Parcel is capable of properly transpiling `node_modules` and relies on Browserslist to figure stuff.
Make sure you have `browserslist` defined. Read more
[in Parcel docs](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/#declaring-browser-targets).

Vite has a special way to handle dependencies transpiling. Read more
[in the related guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/dep-pre-bundling.html).

### Using with Create React App

Create React App transpiles `node_modules` as a part of the build pipeline and relies on
Browserslist to figure what to transpile. Make sure you have `browserslist` properly configured.
Read more
[in CRA docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/supported-browsers-features/#configuring-supported-browsers).

### Using with Webpack & Babel

It is very likely, that your webpack config excludes `node_modules` from running through
`babel-loader` for the sake of faster builds. If any of your targeted environments require code
transpiling to ES5 (e.g. Internet Explorer 11), the config will require some changes to make it work
with `dataclass` (and possibly other dependencies that are published as a modern JS code).

#### Explicit targets including approach

The easiest way to extend your existing webpack config to transpile certain node_modules using
`babel-loader` is to explicitly mention them in `include` property corresponding rule.

_Note: this change can be applied to production config only._

#### Basic dependencies transpiling approach

While the previous approach easily works for `dataclass` and in no way affects the build time, there
is another approach you may consider, that will potentially help you with other dependecies.

_Note: this change can be applied to production config only._
